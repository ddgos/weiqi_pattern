# weiqi_pattern

weiqi patterns provide a format for defining position snippets in
[go](https://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo).

These snippets can then be compared to see how well they match, where best one
pattern matches inside another and the transformation required to produce this
match.

Patterns can be generated from sgfs if the features "from_sgf" and
"from_sgf_cli" are enabled. These features currently only work with 19x19
records.
